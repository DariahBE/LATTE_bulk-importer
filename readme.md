# LATTE Bulk importer. 

This tool is designed to load different CSVs into a NEO4J cypher database. Each subtype of nodes are supposed to be stored in their own CSV file. Across all those files nodes are to be identified with a unique ID.

Edges are imported and connected to the proper nodes by referencing those unique IDs. The designated file for edge information holds no edge properties other than a string representing the label of the relation!
